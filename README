*** Walkthrough the book controller
Introduces a new book and author management API with models, controllers, and routes.
 Updates Author and Book models by adding new fields and correcting model export statements.
 Mounts the new API at the "/reference" path in the server.


Summary
New Book/Author API Module
controllers/book.controller.js, routes/book.routes.js	

Adds three controller handlers (createAuthor, createBook, getBookWithAuthor)
 with standard try/catch error handling. Routes POST and GET endpoints for author and book operations, 
 with book retrieval populating author references.

Model Updates
models/Author.js, models/Book.js	

Adds country field to Author schema and genre field to Book schema.
 Fixes model exports by passing actual schema objects
  instead of string literals to mongoose.model().

Server Integration
server.js	

Imports and mounts book routes at the "/reference" API path.

Documentation Update
controllers/product.controller.js	

Updates non-functional comments in getProductStats to clarify aggregation pipeline stages.
